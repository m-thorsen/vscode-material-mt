## Material Basic

Inspired by, and using token colors from [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), with a few additions and tweaks.

#### Variants
* Teal - resembling the original theme
* Cyan - darker background and cyan highlights to better match the [Adapta GTK theme](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme)

Workbench is of course fully themed.
