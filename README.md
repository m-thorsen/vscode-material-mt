## Material Basic

Inspired by and derived from [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), with a few additions and personal tweaks. 

This theme pack was originally created for personal use (mainly Laravel/Vue-focused), but suggestions/improvements are welcome.

#### Implemented variants
* Materia Basic - Based on the original theme, will fit the original [Adapta GTK Theme](https://github.com/adapta-project/adapta-gtk-theme) 
* Adwaita - Made to fit GNOME's Adwaita Dark theme
* Materia - Made to fit [Materia GTK Theme](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme)
* Materia-Contrast - Materia variant with added contrast and darker editor background

#### Tweaks/additions
* Better support for PHP and Vue
* Highlight current line number
* Highlight current indent guide
* JS/PHP tokens more in line with the Sublime theme
* Less noisy docblocks
* And more...
