## Material Basic

Inspired by and derived from [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme), with a few additions and personal tweaks. 

This theme pack was originally created for personal use (mainly Laravel/Vue-focused), but suggestions/improvements are welcome.

#### Implemented variants
* Teal - Based on the original theme
* Night - Darker background for late night sessions
* Gray - Gray background, blue highlights. Made to fit [Materia GTK Theme by Nana-4](https://github.com/nana-4/materia-theme)
* Breeze Dark - Tinted gray background, blue highlights. Made to fit KDE's Breeze Dark theme

#### Tweaks/additions
* Html attributes in .vue and .blade.php files
* Highlight current line number
* Highlight current indent guide
* JS/PHP tokens more in line with the Sublime theme
* Less noisy docblocks
* And more...

Workbench is of course fully themed.
